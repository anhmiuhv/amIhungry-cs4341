# Assignment 3 CS4301

We use python 3 or above

python main.py -h to know how to run

for example: 

(for windows)	
	python main.py icy=true 1000 exam=true stress=high

We can also do this command to make it similar to the input specific in the assignment document

	ln -s main.py sample

Then for example the input will be

(for windows)	
	python sample icy=true 1000 exam=true stress=high
	
(for linux/mac)
