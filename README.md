# Assignment 3 CS4301

We use python 3 or above, use: 
python main.py -h to know how to run

for example: (for windows)	
python main.py icy=true 1000 exam=true stress=high


Additional notes: 
We can also do this following command to make it similar to the input specify in the assignment document
ln -s main.py sample

Then for example the input will be
(for windows)
	python sample icy=true 1000 exam=true stress=high
